# 🎵 Song Identification, Mood Detection & Music Recommendation Website

### A beginner-friendly web application where users can **upload a short audio clip**, and the system will:

1. **Identify the song**
2. **Detect the mood of the song using Machine Learning**
3. **Recommend similar songs**

</div>



## 🚀 Project Overview

Music platforms like **Shazam** and **Spotify** analyze audio signals to recognize songs and suggest similar music.

## 🧠 System Workflow

1. User uploads an audio clip (5–15 seconds)
2. Backend saves and processes the audio
3. Song is identified using a music recognition API
4. Audio features are extracted
5. ML model predicts the mood
6. Similar songs are recommended
7. Results are displayed on the website

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models Used

This project **intentionally avoids deep learning** to keep it beginner-friendly.



### 🎼 1️⃣ Audio Feature Extraction (Input to ML Models)

Using **Librosa**, we extract numerical features from the audio clip:

- Tempo (BPM)
- Zero Crossing Rate
- Spectral Centroid
- Spectral Bandwidth
- RMS Energy
- MFCCs (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients)

These features convert audio into a **numerical vector**, which ML models can understand.

---

### 😊 2️⃣ Mood Detection Model (Core ML Part)

#### 🎯 Goal
Classify a song into one of the moods:
- Happy
- Sad
- Calm
- Energetic

---

### 🔹 ML Models

You can start with **any one** of these:

#### ✅ Logistic Regression
- Easy to understand
- Fast to train
- Good baseline model

---

### 📊 Training the ML Model

- Dataset: Pre-labeled music datasets (e.g., GTZAN, Free Music Archive)
- Labels: Mood category
- Train-test split: 80/20
- Evaluation metrics:
  - Accuracy
  - Confusion matrix

The trained model is saved using `joblib` or `pickle`.

---

### 🔮 Prediction Flow

1. Audio uploaded by user
2. Features extracted
3. Features passed to trained ML model
4. Model outputs predicted mood
5. Mood shown on frontend



## 🎧 3️⃣ Recommendation Logic (ML + API Based)

### 🔹 Option 1: API-Based Recommendation
- Use Spotify Audio Features:
  - Valence
  - Energy
  - Tempo
- Recommend songs with similar values

### 🔹 Option 2: ML-Based Similarity
- Use **Cosine Similarity**
- Compare feature vectors of songs
- Recommend top N similar songs

📌 Beginners can start with **API-based recommendations**.
